Phase 13: Google Cloud Knowledge Catalog Custom Metadata Aspect Setup Script
=============================================================================
Creates the `enterprise-data-context` AspectType in Google Cloud Knowledge Catalog
(location: `global`) and attaches structured governance metadata aspects across all
140 BigQuery warehouse tables in `ecommerce_dw`.

This structured metadata layer enables Knowledge Catalog semantic search to index
forensic diagnostic summaries, grain definitions, metric measures, and relationship links.
